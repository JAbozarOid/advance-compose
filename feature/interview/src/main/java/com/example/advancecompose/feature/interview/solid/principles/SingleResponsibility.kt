/**
 * Benefits of Following SRP
 * Maintainability: Each class has a clear responsibility, making the code easier to maintain.
 * Testability: Smaller classes with single responsibilities are easier to test.
 * Scalability: Changes in one responsibility donâ€™t affect others, making the codebase more scalable.
 * Reusability: Classes with single responsibilities are more likely to be reused in different parts of the application or in other projects.
